  /* Method Purpose:  Users are prompted for the projected sales revenue, the number of sales reps,
   * the number of quarters a rep has worked, the quarter(s) in which revenue was earned, and the sales revenue
   * for each month within a quarter. If the sales rep is earning 50% or above their target, than an encouraging
   * message is given; otherwise, a warning that sales are lagging behind. If sales revenue for the company is 
   * greater than or equal to 100% of projected annual sales, then employees qualify for a 2-5% year-end bonus;
   * otherwise, the sales are not on track to meet projections, and no year- end bonus can be expected
